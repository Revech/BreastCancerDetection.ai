The Breast Cancer Diagnosis model employs binary classification methodology along with a pre-defined dataset to determine the likelihood of an individual having breast cancer. Demonstrating an accuracy rate of 93%, this model serves as a robust tool for predicting the presence or absence of breast cancer in patients.


Designed using a Sequential model, to which we added a 12 neuron input layer having 30 inputs, a hidden, and an output layer the latter having 1 output and sigmoid activation function.

Trained 5 different models to see if any section of the features had less correlation with the output.
4/5 of the models yielded well above 90% in the evaluation for both training and testing data, meaning that the models were neither underfitting nor overfitting and that there was one specific feature we couldnâ€™t discard.
